# Object Recognition System

This repository contains an object recognition system implemented using TensorFlow in a ReactJS project.

## Description

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the usage of the TensorFlow library to perform object recognition in images or videos. TensorFlow is a powerful open-source library for machine learning and deep learning, widely used in tasks such as image classification and object detection.

## Features

The system offers the following features:

- Object Detection: Identifies and locates objects in images or videos.

- Classification: Predicts the class or label of the detected objects, such as "car," "dog," "chair," etc.

- Real-Time Processing: Performs object recognition in real-time, enabling interactive and dynamic applications.

- User Interface: The system provides a user-friendly interface built with ReactJS, making it easy to interact with and visualize the results of object recognition.

## Prerequisites

Before running the system, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher).

## Installation

- Clone this repository to your local machine:

```git
git clone https://github.com/omatheusribeiro/object-recognition.git
```

- Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd object-recognition
```

- Install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

After the installation is complete, you can run the system as follows:

- Execute the following command to start the local server:

```
npm start
```

- Open your browser and access the following address:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

- On the system's page, you can use your device's camera to perform object recognition.
